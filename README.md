### Features:

- Mechanics will repair vandalized additions (benches, lamps, trash bins ..) a bit more realistic and automated way with random repairing animation
- Repairing will cost normal fee of the addition (mechanics will not repair if there is not enough money)
- Repairing lasts the length of the animation

### Notes:

Only mechanics are able to play fixing animations as far i know so for example handyman is not very suitable for the task.

Plugin works with OpenRCT2 `v0.4.12` or later.  

If you enjoy watching while mechanics are repairing the additions but want to choose which mechanics will repair them, check out the [mechanic manager +](https://github.com/jpknen/openrct2-mechanic-manager-plus) plugin.

### Install:

Copy the latest [release](https://github.com/jpknen/openrct2-animated-vandalism-repairing/releases/) into to your OpenRCT2 plugin folder `C:/Users/[name]/Documents/OpenRCT2/plugin`
