# Animated vandalism repairing

OpenRCT2 plugin for repairing the vandalized additions with random repairing animations.

### Features:

- Mechanics will repair vandalized additions (benches, lamps, trash bins ..) a bit more realistic and automated way with random repairing animation
- Repairing will cost normal fee of the addition
- Repairing lasts the length of the animation

### Notes:

Only mechanics are able to play fixing animations as far i know so for example handyman is not very suitable for the task. And anyway mechanics carry a toolbox instead of a sweeping brush, which obviously cant fix much.

Plugin works with OpenRCT2 `v0.4.12` or later.  

### Install:

Just copy the latest [release](https://github.com/jpknen/openrct2-animated-vandalism-repairing/releases/) into to your OpenRCT2 plugin folder `C:/Users/[name]/Documents/OpenRCT2/plugin`
